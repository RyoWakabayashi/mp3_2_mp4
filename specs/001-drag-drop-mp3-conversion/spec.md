# Feature Specification: Drag & Drop MP3 to MP4 Conversion

**Feature Branch**: `001-drag-drop-mp3-conversion`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ユーザーが mp3 ファイルをドラッグ＆ドロップするとmp4ファイルを生成するようにしたい。インストールは不要、もしくは極力簡単にしたい。画像は必要ないのでmp4は真っ暗な映像に音声だけ流れるものとしたい。"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Single File Conversion (Priority: P1)

A user has an MP3 audio file they want to convert to MP4 format for video platform upload. They drag the MP3 file onto the application window and receive an MP4 file with the same audio content and a black video track.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value - users can convert their audio files without technical knowledge or complex setup.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by dragging one MP3 file onto the application and verifying an MP4 file is created with identical audio and black video.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** user drags an MP3 file onto the window, **Then** conversion starts immediately with progress indicator
2. **Given** conversion is in progress, **When** process completes, **Then** MP4 file is saved to the same directory as the original MP3
3. **Given** conversion completed successfully, **When** user plays the MP4 file, **Then** audio quality matches original MP3 with silent black video

### User Story 2 - Multiple File Batch Conversion (Priority: P2)

A user has multiple MP3 files they want to convert simultaneously. They select multiple MP3 files and drag them onto the application, which processes them sequentially or in parallel.

**Why this priority**: Batch processing significantly improves user efficiency when dealing with multiple files, building on the single file functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by dragging 3-5 MP3 files simultaneously and verifying all are converted to separate MP4 files.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** user drags multiple MP3 files onto the window, **Then** all files are queued for conversion
2. **Given** multiple files are queued, **When** conversion processes them, **Then** progress is shown for each file individually
3. **Given** batch conversion is running, **When** one file fails, **Then** other files continue processing uninterrupted

---

### User Story 3 - Error Recovery and File Validation (Priority: P3)

A user accidentally drags an invalid file (corrupted MP3, wrong format, or very large file) onto the application. The system provides clear feedback and handles the error gracefully.

**Why this priority**: Error handling ensures user confidence and prevents application crashes, but is less critical than core conversion functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by dragging corrupted files, non-audio files, and extremely large files to verify appropriate error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** user drags a non-MP3 file, **Then** application shows clear error message without crashing
2. **Given** user drags a corrupted MP3 file, **When** conversion is attempted, **Then** user receives specific error about file corruption
3. **Given** user drags an extremely large file, **When** system detects size issue, **Then** user is warned about processing time or memory requirements

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the output directory is write-protected or full?
- How does system handle MP3 files with unusual sample rates or bit depths?
- What occurs when user drags the same file multiple times rapidly?
- How does the application behave when system runs out of memory during large file conversion?
- What happens when user tries to close application during active conversion?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept MP3 files via drag and drop interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST convert MP3 audio to MP4 format with black video track
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve original audio quality during conversion
- **FR-004**: System MUST save output files to same directory as input files by default
- **FR-005**: System MUST display conversion progress with percentage completion
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle multiple file conversion in sequence
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate file format before attempting conversion
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages for failed conversions
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to cancel ongoing conversions
- **FR-010**: System MUST work without requiring additional software installation
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate output filenames by appending suffix to preserve original names

### Key Entities

- **Audio File**: MP3 format input file with metadata (title, artist, duration, bitrate)
- **Video File**: MP4 format output file containing original audio track and generated silent black video track
- **Conversion Job**: Processing task with status (queued, processing, completed, failed), progress percentage, and error information

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully convert MP3 to MP4 in under 30 seconds for files up to 10MB
- **SC-002**: 95% of valid MP3 files are converted without errors
- **SC-003**: Application launches and becomes ready for use within 5 seconds on Windows systems
- **SC-004**: Batch conversion of 10 files completes with progress feedback for each file
- **SC-005**: Users can operate the application without reading documentation or help files
- **SC-006**: Application consumes less than 512MB RAM during typical single file conversion
- **SC-007**: Output MP4 files are playable in standard video players (Windows Media Player, VLC)
- **SC-008**: No additional software dependencies required for end users on fresh Windows installations

## Assumptions

- Users primarily use Windows operating systems for final deployment
- MP3 files are typically under 100MB in size for music tracks
- Users expect output files in the same location as input files
- Black video track is acceptable for audio-only content conversion
- Standard MP3 formats (44.1kHz, various bitrates) are the primary input
- Users prefer GUI over command-line interface
- Internet connection is not required for conversion process
