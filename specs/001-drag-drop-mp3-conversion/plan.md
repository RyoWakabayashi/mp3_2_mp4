# Implementation Plan: Drag & Drop MP3 to MP4 Conversion

**Branch**: `001-drag-drop-mp3-conversion` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-drag-drop-mp3-conversion/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a desktop application that converts MP3 audio files to MP4 video files (with black video track) through drag-and-drop interface. Must work without installation on Windows systems and support development on macOS. Requirements include batch processing, progress indicators, and robust error handling.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ with tkinter + customtkinter  
**Primary Dependencies**: FFmpeg via python-ffmpeg, PyInstaller for distribution  
**Storage**: File-based (no database, temporary files during conversion)  
**Testing**: pytest + pytest-qt for GUI testing, sample MP3 files  
**Target Platform**: Desktop GUI - Windows 10+ (primary), macOS 12+ (development)
**Project Type**: Single desktop application  
**Performance Goals**: Convert 10MB MP3 in <30 seconds, <512MB RAM usage  
**Constraints**: Zero-install on Windows, self-contained distribution, GUI responsiveness  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop app, batch processing up to 50 files

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. User-First Design ✅

- GUI drag-and-drop interface prioritizes non-engineer usability
- 30-second testability requirement met with simple drag-drop operation
- Plain language error messages planned

### II. Cross-Platform Compatibility ✅

- Windows (primary) and macOS (development) support planned
- FFmpeg core logic is platform-agnostic
- Platform-specific GUI adapters required

### III. Self-Contained Distribution ✅

- Zero-install requirement explicitly stated
- Bundle all dependencies including FFmpeg
- Single executable or folder distribution planned

### IV. Robust Error Handling ✅

- File validation before conversion
- Cancellable operations with progress indicators
- Graceful handling of corrupted files and system resource limits

### V. Performance Transparency ✅

- Progress indicators for operations >2 seconds
- Batch operations with individual file progress
- Background processing without UI blocking

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASS - All constitutional principles addressed in specification

### Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation ✅

- **User-First Design**: tkinter + customtkinter provides intuitive GUI, drag-drop interface
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python + FFmpeg proven cross-platform solution
- **Self-Contained Distribution**: PyInstaller with bundled FFmpeg meets zero-install requirement
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling contracts defined
- **Performance Transparency**: Progress callbacks and UI responsiveness addressed in design

**FINAL GATE STATUS**: ✅ PASS - Technical implementation aligns with constitutional principles

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected as this is a standalone desktop application. Core conversion logic separated from GUI to enable platform-specific GUI implementations while maintaining shared business logic.
