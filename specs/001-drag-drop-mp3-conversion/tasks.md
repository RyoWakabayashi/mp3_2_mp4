# Tasks: Drag & Drop MP3 to MP4 Conversion

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-drag-drop-mp3-conversion/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included for comprehensive validation of the desktop application

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Desktop application with GUI and core conversion logic

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan with src/, tests/, assets/, docs/ directories
- [x] T002 Initialize Python project with requirements.txt and mise configuration in .mise.toml
- [x] T003 [P] Configure development dependencies in requirements-dev.txt (pytest, pytest-qt, black, flake8, mypy)
- [x] T004 [P] Setup sample MP3 files for testing in assets/samples/
- [x] T005 [P] Create application icons in assets/icons/ for Windows and macOS
- [x] T006 [P] Configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- [x] T007 Create main.py entry point in src/main.py with basic argument parsing

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T009 Create ConversionJob model in src/models/conversion_job.py with status enumeration
- [x] T010 Create VideoFile model in src/models/video_file.py with output specifications
- [x] T011 Create ApplicationState model in src/models/application_state.py for global state management
- [x] T012 Setup FFmpeg integration service in src/services/ffmpeg_service.py with validation and conversion methods
- [x] T013 Create file validation utilities in src/utils/file_validator.py for MP3 format checking
- [x] T014 [P] Setup error handling framework in src/utils/error_handler.py with user-friendly messages
- [x] T015 [P] Create logging configuration in src/utils/logger.py with debug and production modes
- [x] T016 Create base GUI application window in src/gui/main_window.py using tkinter + customtkinter

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Single File Conversion (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 drag-drop handler but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances validation from US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services (Phase 2 provides base models)
- Services before GUI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- GUI components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for single file validation in tests/unit/test_file_validator.py"
Task: "Unit test for FFmpeg conversion in tests/unit/test_ffmpeg_service.py"
Task: "Integration test for end-to-end single file conversion in tests/integration/test_single_conversion.py"
Task: "GUI automation test for drag-drop interface in tests/gui/test_drag_drop.py"

# Launch parallel GUI components for User Story 1:
Task: "Implement drag-and-drop handler in src/gui/drag_drop_handler.py"
Task: "Create progress indicator widget in src/gui/progress_widget.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Create basic Windows executable for user testing

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Create MVP build (basic single file conversion)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Create enhanced build (batch processing)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Create robust build (error handling)
5. Polish phase ‚Üí Production-ready distribution packages

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (core conversion)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (batch processing)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (error handling)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
