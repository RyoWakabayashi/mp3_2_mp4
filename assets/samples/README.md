# Sample MP3 Files for Testing

This directory contains sample MP3 files for testing the conversion functionality.

## Files

- `sample_short.mp3` - Short 5-second audio clip for quick testing
- `sample_medium.mp3` - Medium 30-second audio clip for standard testing  
- `sample_corrupted.mp3` - Intentionally corrupted file for error handling tests
- `sample_large.mp3` - Large file for performance testing (>10MB)

## Usage

These files are used by:
- Unit tests for file validation
- Integration tests for conversion functionality
- GUI tests for drag-and-drop operations
- Performance benchmarking

## Note

Actual MP3 files need to be added separately as they are binary files.
For development, you can use any MP3 files and rename them appropriately.
